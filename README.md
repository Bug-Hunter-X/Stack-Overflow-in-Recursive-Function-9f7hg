# Stack Overflow Bug in Hack
This repository demonstrates a common stack overflow error in recursive functions written in Hack. The `foo` function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  When called with a large input, it exceeds the maximum recursion depth, resulting in a stack overflow.
The solution provides an iterative approach to avoid the stack overflow error.  This illustrates a best practice of using iterative solutions for tasks that could potentially cause stack overflow issues when handled recursively.
